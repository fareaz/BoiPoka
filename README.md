# 📚 BoiPoka

**BoiPoka** is a simple experimental book listing web application where users can browse books and manage two personal lists:

- ✅ **Read List (Listed)**
- ⭐ **Wishlist (Watchlist)**

The app is completely client-side and uses **localStorage** to save user selections.  
It is built for practicing React fundamentals, routing, and basic persistent UI state.
